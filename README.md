# Slot Machine using Python
### This is my 9th Project which is part of my 100 Python Projects in 100 Days series

This is a text based slot machine. The user will bet a certain amount of money and he can either bet on 1,2 or 3 lines of the slot machine just to keep it simple. Their bet will be multiplied with the no. of lines they got and that will be added to their balance. They can keep playing until they want to cash out or until they run out of money.
